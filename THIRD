Subject: Data Quality Issues & Key Insights from Transaction Analysis

Hi Kayla Donnell,

I’ve been analyzing our transaction, user, and product data to identify key trends and assess data quality. Here are my findings:

Data Quality Issues:
Missing Data – Significant gaps in key fields:
User Data: 30,508 missing language values, 5,892 missing gender values, and 3,675 missing birth dates.
Product Data: Over 226,000 missing manufacturer and brand entries, making it difficult to track product-level insights.
Transaction Data: 5,762 missing barcodes, impacting our ability to map sales to specific products.
Data Inconsistencies – Some fields have unexpected values, like "zero" appearing as text in FINAL_QUANTITY, which may cause reporting errors.
Key Trend Identified:
One standout insight: Coca-Cola is the top-performing brand by both number of transactions and total sales, across different user segments.

It ranks as the most frequently purchased brand among users 21+ and those with accounts older than six months.
This suggests strong brand loyalty and consistent purchase behavior, possibly indicating an opportunity for targeted promotions or partnerships.
Outstanding Questions & Next Steps:
To refine our insights, I need help addressing the following:

Can we confirm the accuracy of missing barcode data? If a significant portion of transactions lack barcodes, it may skew our brand-level analysis.
Are there any expected data constraints for product details (brand, manufacturer)? If this data isn’t systematically captured, we may need alternative ways to categorize sales trends.
Should we clean and standardize FINAL_QUANTITY values to ensure accurate reporting?
Would love to discuss these findings in more detail. Let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into the data or if we should pull in other stakeholders to address the gaps.

Thanks,
