1..Are there any data quality issues present?
Data Quality Issues Identified:
1.Missing Values:
Transaction Data:
BARCODE: 5,762 missing values.
User Data:
BIRTH_DATE: 3,675 missing values.
STATE: 4,812 missing values.
LANGUAGE: 30,508 missing values.
GENDER: 5,892 missing values.
Product Data:
CATEGORY_1: 111 missing values.
CATEGORY_2: 1,424 missing values.
CATEGORY_3: 60,566 missing values.
CATEGORY_4: 778,093 missing values (almost all missing).
MANUFACTURER: 226,474 missing values.
BRAND: 226,472 missing values.
BARCODE: 4,025 missing values.
2.Duplicate Entries:
TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv: 171 duplicates.
USER_TAKEHOME.csv: 0 duplicates.
PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv: 215 duplicates.
Inconsistent Data Types:
3.In Transaction Data:
BARCODE is stored as a float, but it should likely be a string to avoid scientific notation issues.
FINAL_QUANTITY contains inconsistent values (e.g., "zero" instead of numeric values).
In Product Data:
BARCODE is also a float, which could lead to truncation issues.

# Import the necessary library
import pandas as pd

# Load the transaction data file into a pandas DataFrame
# This file contains details about transactions, including receipt ID, purchase date, user ID, barcode, and final sale information.
transaction_df = pd.read_csv("/mnt/data/TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv")

# Load the user data file into a pandas DataFrame
# This file contains user-related information such as user ID, birth date, state, language, and gender.
user_df = pd.read_csv("/mnt/data/USER_TAKEHOME.csv")

# Load the products data file into a pandas DataFrame
# This file includes product details such as category, manufacturer, brand, and barcode information.
products_df = pd.read_csv("/mnt/data/PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME (1).csv")

# Display the first few rows of each DataFrame
# This helps to understand the structure of the data and detect any potential issues, such as missing values or incorrect formatting.
transaction_df.head(), user_df.head(), products_df.head()

2.Fields That Are Challenging to Understand:
FINAL_QUANTITY (Transaction Data)
Contains "zero" as a text value instead of numeric 0.00. This may cause issues in calculations.
CATEGORY_3 and CATEGORY_4 (Product Data)
High number of missing values, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights.
MANUFACTURER and BRAND (Product Data)
Many missing values and placeholder text like "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER", making it hard to trust the data.
LANGUAGE (User Data)
Contains some non-standard values like es-419 which may need clarification on whether it represents a specific Spanish locale.:
