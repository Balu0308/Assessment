3.Inconsistent Data Types:
In Transaction Data:
BARCODE is stored as a float, but it should likely be a string to avoid scientific notation issues.
FINAL_QUANTITY contains inconsistent values (e.g., "zero" instead of numeric values).
In Product Data:
BARCODE is also a float, which could lead to truncation issues.

2.Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?
Fields That Are Challenging to Understand:
FINAL_QUANTITY (Transaction Data)
Contains "zero" as a text value instead of numeric 0.00. This may cause issues in calculations.
CATEGORY_3 and CATEGORY_4 (Product Data)
High number of missing values, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights.
MANUFACTURER and BRAND (Product Data)
Many missing values and placeholder text like "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER", making it hard to trust the data.
LANGUAGE (User Data)
Contains some non-standard values like es-419 which may need clarification on whether it represents a specific Spanish locale.:
